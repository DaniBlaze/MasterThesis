This paper critically reviewed Ricardo Perez-Truglia's article on: "The Effects of Income Transparency on Well-Being: Evidence from a Natural Experiment". The resulting findings from the review showed that assumptions related to parallel trends in outcome and the SUTVA-framework can arguably not have been met, which weakens the possibility of drawing causal inference. The identification strategies, specifications and supplementary analysis strengthens the ability to draw causal inference between increased income transparency and subjective well-being.
