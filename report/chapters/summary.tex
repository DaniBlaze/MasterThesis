This paper explores recurrent neural networks' ability to predict out-of sample small cap stock returns for securities currently listed at the Oslo Stock Exchange (2021).   the tentative plan for assessing the topic of predicting small cap stock returns on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The aim of the paper is to explore the predictive performance of deep learning algorithms when applied to stock returns, and compare returns for both large cap stocks and small cap stocks. It presents previous research and literature within the field, and theory related to deep learning and neural networks. It also provides current suggestions on choice of research design and methodology, which includes the suggested algorithms to be implemented, how stock returns will be predicted and measured, and which variables to be incorporated in the model training and testing. Lastly, a tentative plan for data collection and analysis is presented.
